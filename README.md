# DevJourney

Welcome to **DevJourney** — my personal repository where I document every programming language, framework, and skill I learn on my coding journey.
My goal is to become a high skilled developer.

## 📚 What’s Inside?

This repo is organized by programming languages and technologies. Each language or skill will have its own folder, containing code examples, notes, exercises, and related resources.

- **Python/** — This folder focuses on Python basics and advanced topics. It has its own dedicated README with more details.
- *(Other folders to come as I continue learning — like Java, JavaScript, C++, and more)*

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repo is to:

- Keep track of my progress and learning journey in public.
