# DevJourney

Welcome to **DevJourney** — my personal repository where I document every programming language, framework, and skill I learn on my coding journey.
My goal is to become a high skilled developer.

- *(Other folders to come as I continue learning — like JavaScript, C++, and more)*

## 📝 Note

- I do not copy any code from any source or AI when I am learning a language. Every line of code and comment is written by me by myself.
- I do all exercises by myself and only sometimes ask either my seniors or chatGPT to explain me the logic when I feel stuck. After understanding the logic I write the syntax myself to implement what I understood.
