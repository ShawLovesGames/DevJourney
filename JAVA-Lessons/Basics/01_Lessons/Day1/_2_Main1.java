public class _2_Main1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("public static void main(String[] args){} is the main() method."); 
    }
}

/*
    Explanation :-
    public class Main → Everything in Java is inside a class. The file name must match the class name (Main1.java → Main1 class).
    public static void main(String[] args) → The main method is where the program starts running.
    A class defines what something is and what it can do (its properties and behaviors).
    I will learn about classes later in the lessons.
