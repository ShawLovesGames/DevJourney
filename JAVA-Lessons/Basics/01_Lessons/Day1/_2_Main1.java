// ---Main & Class---

public class _2_Main1 {
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        System.out.println("public static void main(String[] args){} is the main() method.");
        System.out.println("Any code inside the main() method will be executed.");
    }
}
/*
    Explanation :-
    public class Main → Everything in Java is inside a class. The file name must match the class name (Main1.java → Main1 class).
    System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output".
    public static void main(String[] args) → The main method is where the program starts running.
    A class defines what something is and what it can do (its properties and behaviors).
    I will learn about classes later in the lessons.
