# ---Program to input two numbers and performing addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations on them---

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))
sum = num1 + num2 # Addition
diff = num1 - num2 # Subtraction
prod = num1 * num2 # Multiplication
quot = num1 / num2 # Division
print("Sum: " + str(sum))
print("Difference: " + str(diff))
print("Product: " + str(prod))
print("Quotient: " + str(quot))
