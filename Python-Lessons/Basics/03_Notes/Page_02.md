# **Notes #2**

### **Decorators**
- Decorators are used to add extra behaviour to a python function without changing the function code
- Decorator is a function that takes another function as input and returns a new function
- A decorator can be called multiple times
- Decorators allow arguments when the function requires an argument if we pass the arguments through the wrapper function
- Decorators also allow their own arguments
- We can use multiple decorators on one function

### **Range**
- The range() function returns an immutable sequence of numbers
- We mainly use it to loop a specific number of times
- The set of numbers has its own data type called range
- If one argument is used then it represents the stop value and the start value defaults at 0
- If two arguments are used, the first argument represents the start value and the second argument represents the stop value
- If three arguments are used, the first argument represents the start value, the second argument represents the stop value and the third argument represents the step value
