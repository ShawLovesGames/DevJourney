# Operators are used to perform operations on two or more operands

# Types of Operators in python: (I copied these from w3 schools, studied about them and then wrote their usages myself)
#1. Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **      ||  Used to perform mathematical operations
#2. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=     ||  Used to assign values to variables
#3. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=       ||  Used to compare values between variables
#4. Logical Operators: and, or, not      ||  Used to combine conditional statements
#5. Identity Operators: is, is not     ||  Used to check if two variables are the same object
#6. Membership Operators: in, not in   ||  Used to check if a value is present in a sequence
#7. Bitwise Operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>    ||  Used to perform bit-level operations

n1 = 5 # Assigning value to variables using '=' operator
n2 = 4
sum = n1 + n2 # Performing addition using '+' operator
print(sum)

# Operators Precedence in Python: (I copied these from w3 schools and will try to keep these in mind)
#1. Parentheses: ()
#2. Exponentiation: **
#3. Unary plus and minus: +x, -x
#4. Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, Modulus: *, /, //, %
#5. Addition, Subtraction: +, -
#6. Bitwise Shift Operators: <<, >>
#7. Bitwise AND: &
#8. Bitwise XOR: ^
#9. Bitwise OR: |
#10. Comparison Operators: ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
#11. Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, //=, %=, **=, &=, |=, ^=, <<=, >>=
#12. Identity Operators: is, is not
#13. Membership Operators: in, not in
