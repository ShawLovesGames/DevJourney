1. Print first N palindrome numbers
2. Print an right angle triangle using positive integers

📂 **Code:** [Python-Lessons/Basics/02_Exercises/PracticeOnlyDays/Day1](Basics/02_Exercises/PracticeOnlyDays/Day1)

### **Day 2 - 27 Aug 2025**
- Still recovering. Did 6 exercises today and revised a little
- Created a /randomDays/ folder (lazy I know, will change later) which will be used when I only do questions to keep track of days
